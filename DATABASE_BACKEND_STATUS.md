# Database & Backend Status Report

## 📊 **What Has Been Done**

### **Firebase Setup**
✅ Firebase project initialized (`pillsync-360`)
✅ Firebase configuration files created:
   - `src/firebase.js` - Firebase app initialization
   - `firebase.json` - Firebase project configuration
   - `firestore.rules` - Security rules (temporary, expires Nov 2025)
   - `firestore.indexes.json` - Index configuration (empty)
✅ Database location configured: `asia-south1`
✅ Firebase SDK dependencies installed (`firebase@^12.5.0`)

### **External API Integration**
✅ **RxNav API Integration** (`components/InteractionChecker.tsx`):
   - Drug name to RxCUI conversion
   - Drug-drug interaction checking
   - Uses: `https://rxnav.nlm.nih.gov/REST/`

✅ **OCR Integration** (`components/UploadSection.tsx`):
   - Tesseract.js for prescription image processing
   - Extracts medication names and dosages from images
   - Client-side processing

### **Data Models Defined** (`lib/store.tsx`)
✅ TypeScript interfaces defined:
   - `Medication` - Medicine details (name, dosage, frequency, dates)
   - `DosageChange` - Dosage change history
   - `StoreState` - Profile, medications, dosageChanges

---

## ❌ **What Needs to Be Done**

### **🔥 CRITICAL: Database Integration**

#### **1. Firestore Database Operations**
❌ **No Firestore collections are being used** - All data is stored in `localStorage` only
❌ Need to create Firestore collections:
   - `users/{userId}/profile` - User profile data
   - `users/{userId}/medications` - User's medication list
   - `users/{userId}/dosageChanges` - Dosage change history
   - `users/{userId}/reminders` - Medication reminders/schedules
   - `users/{userId}/adherence` - Medication adherence tracking
   - `users/{userId}/emergencyCards` - Emergency card generation history
   - `users/{userId}/prescriptions` - Uploaded prescription images/metadata

❌ Replace `localStorage` operations in `lib/store.tsx` with Firestore:
   - Currently: `localStorage.getItem("hc_store")` and `localStorage.setItem("hc_store", ...)`
   - Need: Firestore `getDoc`, `setDoc`, `updateDoc`, `addDoc`, `deleteDoc`

#### **2. User Authentication**
❌ **Authentication is NOT implemented** - Login/Signup pages are UI only:
   - `app/login/page.tsx` - Form has no Firebase Auth integration
   - `app/signup/page.tsx` - Form has no Firebase Auth integration
   - `public/index.html` has example code but not connected to Next.js pages

❌ Need to implement:
   - Email/password authentication
   - User session management
   - Protected routes (redirect to login if not authenticated)
   - Role-based access (patient, caregiver, doctor)
   - User registration with profile creation

#### **3. Real-time Data Synchronization**
❌ No real-time listeners for:
   - Medication updates
   - Profile changes
   - Reminder notifications
   - Adherence tracking updates

❌ Need to implement `onSnapshot` listeners where appropriate

#### **4. Security Rules** (`firestore.rules`)
❌ Current rules are **INSECURE** - allows anyone to read/write everything until Nov 2025
❌ Need proper security rules:
   ```javascript
   // Example structure needed:
   match /users/{userId} {
     allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
     match /medications/{medId} {
       allow read: if request.auth != null;
       allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
     }
   }
   ```
❌ Role-based access control (doctors read-only, caregivers can edit, etc.)

#### **5. Database Indexes** (`firestore.indexes.json`)
❌ Indexes file is empty - no query optimizations
❌ Need indexes for common queries:
   - Medications by user + date range
   - Dosage changes by medication
   - Adherence records by date
   - Emergency cards by expiration

#### **6. Component Integration with Firestore**

**Missing Firestore operations in:**

❌ **`components/MedicineList.tsx`**
   - Add medication → Should create Firestore document
   - Update medication → Should update Firestore document
   - Delete medication → Should delete Firestore document
   - Load medications → Should read from Firestore

❌ **`components/ProfileSection.tsx`**
   - Load profile → Should read from Firestore
   - Edit profile → Should update Firestore document

❌ **`components/ReminderSection.tsx`**
   - Load reminders → Should read from Firestore
   - Add reminder → Should create Firestore document
   - Update/Delete reminder → Firestore operations

❌ **`components/AdherenceTracker.tsx`**
   - Track medication taken → Should write to Firestore
   - Calculate adherence → Should query Firestore records

❌ **`components/EmergencyButton.tsx`**
   - Generate emergency card → Currently uses localStorage
   - Should create Firestore document with expiration
   - Emergency view should read from Firestore

❌ **`app/emergency/[id]/page.tsx`**
   - Currently reads from localStorage
   - Should read from Firestore collection

#### **7. Next.js API Routes** (Optional but recommended)
❌ No API routes created (`app/api/` directory doesn't exist)
❌ Consider creating for:
   - Server-side validation
   - Scheduled tasks (reminder notifications)
   - Webhooks (if integrating external services)
   - PDF generation for reports
   - Email notifications

#### **8. Error Handling & Offline Support**
❌ No error handling for Firestore operations
❌ No offline data persistence strategy
❌ No retry logic for failed operations

#### **9. Data Migration**
❌ No migration path from localStorage to Firestore
❌ Need utility to migrate existing localStorage data to Firestore

---

## 🔧 **Implementation Priority**

### **Phase 1: Critical (Must Have)**
1. ✅ Set up Firebase Auth in login/signup pages
2. ✅ Replace localStorage with Firestore in `lib/store.tsx`
3. ✅ Implement CRUD operations for medications
4. ✅ Implement user profile storage
5. ✅ Update security rules

### **Phase 2: Important (Should Have)**
6. ✅ Implement reminders storage
7. ✅ Implement adherence tracking
8. ✅ Migrate emergency cards to Firestore
9. ✅ Add database indexes

### **Phase 3: Enhancement (Nice to Have)**
10. ✅ Real-time sync with `onSnapshot`
11. ✅ Offline support
12. ✅ Next.js API routes for server-side operations
13. ✅ Push notifications for reminders

## 📝 **Files That Need Modification**

1. `src/firebase.js` - Add Firestore and Auth exports
2. `lib/store.tsx` - Replace localStorage with Firestore
3. `app/login/page.tsx` - Add Firebase Auth
4. `app/signup/page.tsx` - Add Firebase Auth + user creation
5. `components/MedicineList.tsx` - Firestore operations
6. `components/ProfileSection.tsx` - Firestore operations
7. `components/ReminderSection.tsx` - Firestore operations
8. `components/AdherenceTracker.tsx` - Firestore operations
9. `components/EmergencyButton.tsx` - Firestore operations
10. `app/emergency/[id]/page.tsx` - Read from Firestore
11. `firestore.rules` - Proper security rules
12. `firestore.indexes.json` - Add required indexes

---

## 🔐 **Security Concerns**

⚠️ **IMMEDIATE ISSUES:**
- Security rules allow public read/write access
- API keys exposed in client-side code (consider environment variables)
- No authentication required for any operations
- Emergency cards stored in localStorage (no expiration enforcement)

---

## 📊 **Current Data Flow**

```
User Action → Component → localStorage → Component Re-render
```

## 📊 **Target Data Flow**

```
User Action → Component → Firestore → Real-time Update → All Connected Clients
                    ↓
            Firebase Auth (verify user)
                    ↓
            Security Rules (validate access)
```

---

## 🎯 **Summary**

**Status:** The project has Firebase **configured** but **not integrated**. All functionality currently uses browser localStorage, making it:
- Not persistent across devices
- Not shareable between users
- Not secure
- Not scalable

**Next Steps:** Implement Firestore database operations and Firebase Authentication to transform this from a prototype into a production-ready application.
