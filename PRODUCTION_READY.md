## 📝 Pre-Deployment Tasks

### 1. Environment Variables

**Frontend (`.env.local`)** ✅ Created
- All `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables set
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` = `http://localhost:5000` (update after backend deploy)

**Backend (`backend/.env`)** ⚠️ Needs Firebase Admin SDK credentials
- Get from Firebase Console → Service Accounts
- Update before deploying

### 2. Local Testing

Run these commands to test:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
npm run dev
```

Test checklist:
- [ ] Backend health check: `curl http://localhost:5000/health`
- [ ] Frontend loads: `http://localhost:3000`
- [ ] Sign up / Login works
- [ ] Add medication works (check backend logs)
- [ ] Medication appears in list
- [ ] Update/Delete works
